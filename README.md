# ghibli-quiz
A really simple project in pure JS to learn how to interact with APIs. 
The API in question can be found here: http://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/

Yes, I am aware that I am making far too many calls to the API and I could've just downloaded the dataset at once and used that. But I've never written JS before in my life so I'm learning more about callback hell okay. Maybe in the future I'll redo this project in React or something.

# Bugs
- Sometimes you'll get a duplicate option in the answers
- For the 'Age' category, some entries in the API are "", "Unspecified" and "NA". Might cause confusion for a user.
- You tell me
